#
# Changes:  in most of the cases you should not modify this
#           file, but provide customizations in fail2ban.local file,
#           or separate .conf files under fail2ban.d/ directory, e.g.:
#
# HOW TO ACTIVATE JAILS:
#
# YOU SHOULD NOT MODIFY THIS FILE.
#
# It will probably be overwritten or improved in a distribution update.
#
# Provide customizations in a fail2ban.local file or a jail.d/customisation.local.
# For example to change the default bantime for all jails and to enable the
# ssh-iptables jail the following (uncommented) would appear in the .local file.
# See the MANUAL for details.
#
# [DEFAULT]
# bantime = 3600
#
# [ssh-iptables]
# enabled = true

# Option: loglevel
# Notes.: Set the log level output.

#         WARNING
#         NOTICE

# Default: ERROR
loglevel = {{ fail2ban_loglevel }}

# Option: logtarget
# Notes.: Set the log target. This could be a file, SYSLOG, STDERR or STDOUT.
#         Only one log target can be specified.
#         If you change logtarget from the default value and you are
#         using logrotate -- also adjust or disable rotation in the
#         corresponding configuration file
#         (e.g. /etc/logrotate.d/fail2ban on Debian systems)
# Values: [ STDOUT | STDERR | SYSLOG | SYSOUT | file ]
# Default: STDERR
logtarget = {{ fail2ban_logtarget }}

# Option: syslogsocket
# Notes.: Set the syslog socket file. Only used when logtarget is SYSLOG
#         auto uses platform.system() to determine predefined paths
# Values: [ auto | file ]
# Default: auto
syslogsocket = auto

# Option: socket
# Notes.: Set the socket file. This is used to communicate with the daemon. Do
#         not remove this file when Fail2ban runs. It will not be possible to
#         communicate with the server afterwards.
# Values: [ file ]
# Default: /var/run/fail2ban/fail2ban.sock
socket = {{ fail2ban_socket }}

# Option: pidfile
# Notes.: Set the PID file. This is used to store the process ID of the
#         fail2ban server.
# Values: [ file ]
# Default: /var/run/fail2ban/fail2ban.pid
pidfile = {{ fail2ban_pidfile }}

# Options: dbfile
# Notes.: Set the file for the fail2ban persistent datastore. A value of ":memory:"
#         uses database in memory, otherwise a file on disk is used. In this case
#         study `dbpurgeage` for usage advice.
# Values: [ None :memory: FILE ]
# Default: /var/lib/fail2ban/fail2ban.sqlite3
dbfile = {{ fail2ban_dbfile }}

# Options: dbpurgeage
# Notes.: Sets age at which bans should be purged from the database
# Values: [ SECONDS ]
# Default: 86400 (24hours)
